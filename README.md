# hello-world
My name is Christopher. I have spent the last 10-years working in aviation. Although this has enabled me to see the not-so-touristy parts of the world, the job itself is highly procedural and not particularly stimulating - nor creative. I am particularly interested in mathematics and statistics. The cataclysmic covid-19 meltdown of the aviation industry has galvanised my decision to 'return to school' and study statistics, with a view to enter the world of big data.

As prepatory work while I wait for enrolments to open, I am taking introductory programming courses on Coursera. This is how I found github.
